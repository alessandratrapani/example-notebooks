# Example Sessions for Dandiset 000971

This submission provides 2 notebooks showcasing example sessions for the Dandiset 000971, which corresponds to the 2022 Current Biology paper: [Dopamine signaling in the dorsomedial striatum promotes compulsive behavior](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.01.055.) by Seiler et al.

Each notebook provides an example of how to access the critical data and metadata from the 2 types of experiments in the dataset:

- `fiber_photometry_example_notebook.ipynb` showcases one example session from the 000971 dataset containing operant behavior and concurrent fiber photometry recordings.
- `optogenetics_example_notebook.ipynb` showcases one example session from the 000971 dataset containing operant behavior and concurrent excitatory optogenetic stimulation.
