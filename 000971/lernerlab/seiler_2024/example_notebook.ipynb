       "  description: Male and female WT (C57BL/6J) and (DAT)::IRES-Cre knockin mice (JAX006660) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and crossed in house. Only heterozygote transgenic mice, obtained by backcrossing to C57BL/6J wildtypes, were used for experiments. Littermates of the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups (fiber photometry-14 males, 22 females; DMS excitatory optogenetics- 20 males, 19 females; DMS inhibitory optogenetics- 13 males, 13 females; DLS excitatory optogenetics- 18 males, 18 females). Adult mice at least 10 weeks of age were used in all experiments. Mice were group housed under a conventional 12 h light cycle (dark from 7:00pm to 7:00am) with ad libitum access to food and water prior to operant training. All experiments were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n",
