This is a collection of introductory notebooks to the IBL datasets.
Those notebooks were written for the NeuroDataReHack 2023 event held in Granada, Spain.


The notebooks are organized in the following way:
- `01_list_datasets.ipynb`: lists all the datasets available on the IBL, organize in a dataframe and search for brain regions
- `02_behaviour_psychometric_curve.ipynb`: a minimal example to stream a dataset, load a trial table and plot a psychometric curve
- `03_analysis_Imbizo_2023.ipynb`: a more complete tutorial on how to load a dataset, load the spike sorted data, select good units and decode a few behavioral features from the data.
