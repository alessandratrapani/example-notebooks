# Unique functional responses differentially map onto genetic subtypes of dopamine neurons tutorial

This example notebook demonstrates how to access the dataset published at [DANDI:001038](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001038/draft).

This dataset contains fiber photometry recordings from head-fixed mice running on a treadmill while receiving rewards
and aversive air puffs in order to analyze differences or similarities in functional responses of different subtypes of 
striatonigral dopamine neurons.

## Installing the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dandi/example-notebooks
cd example-notebooks/001038/DombeckLab
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate dombecklab_001038_demo
```

## Running the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook 001038_demo.ipynb
```
