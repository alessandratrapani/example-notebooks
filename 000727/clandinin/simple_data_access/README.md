This is just a simple notebook to demonstrate how to access data on DANDI using the Python API. 

The data corresponds to the paper in [Mapping the Neural Dynamics of Locomotion across the Drosophila Brain](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.20.485047v1) published by Luke Brezovec 
from the Clandinin lab at Stanford University.
