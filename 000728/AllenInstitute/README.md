# Allen Institute - Visual Coding - Optical Physiology

This notebook and accompanying JSON metadata files are a full demo of the Visual Coding (Ophys) dataset corresponding to Dandiset `000728`.

The notebook has been confirmed to work in the frozen environment specified by the `environment.yaml` file - to install this environment for yourself, run...

```
conda env create -f visual_coding_ophys_notebook_environment.yml
```

This notebook was derived from past work in the [Brain Observatory Examples](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/brain_observatory_examples) repository, in particular [the 2022 version](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/brain_observatory_examples/blob/d579969f2a5015a77da4615d4686f94a9f6121a4/BMM%202022/2P%20Visual%20Coding%20Tutorial.ipynb). It has been adapted to run without use of the AllenSDK and only rely on internal NWB file (version 2) content and the accompanying JSON files.
