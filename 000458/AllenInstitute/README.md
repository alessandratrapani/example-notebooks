# Reanalysis of Dandiset 000458

This submission provides a walkthrough of basic reanalysis of Dandiset #000458: `reanalysis.ipynb`

The notebook makes an approximate reproduction of Figure 4B from the 2023 _Neuron_ article [“Active cortical networks promote shunting fast synaptic inhibition _in vivo_”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.08.005) by Burman et al.

It is meant as a companion to the upcoming blog post: ["Unraveling Anesthesia's Effect on Brain Activity"](https://github.com/dandi/dandi.github.io/pull/74)
