This folder contains a notebook that demonstrates how to work with dandiset 000363. 

`browse_map_ephys_data.ipynb` demonstrates how to navigate a single `.nwb` file from
dataset 000363. This dataset was generated from the [map
ephys](https://github.com/mesoscale-activity-map/map-ephys) pipeline. 

The notebook demonstrates the contents of the `.nwb` file including acquiring the ccf
coordinates, creating rasters aligned to specific events, and browsing the dandiset
without downloading the file locally.
